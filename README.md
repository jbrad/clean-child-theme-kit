# Clean Child Theme Kit

## Description

This is a "getting started" child theme kit for [Clean](http://cleantheme.co), crafted by [Jason Bradley](http://jasonbradley.me).

The [Clean Child Theme Kit](https://github.com/jbrad/clean-child-theme-kit) requires Clean Theme.

## Installation

*Note: Clean must be installed first for the Clean Child Theme Kit to work correctly.*

There are two ways to install WordPress themes / child themes: via the WordPress Dashboard (recommended) and via FTP. 

### Using the WordPress Dashboard

1. Download the [Clean Child Theme Kit](https://github.com/jbrad/clean-child-theme-kit/zipball/master).
2. Locate the "Appearance" menu.
3. In the "Appearance" menu, click on "Themes".
4. On the "Themes" page, click on the "Install Themes" tab.
5. Click on the "Upload" link at the top of the page.
6. On the "Upload" page, locate the theme / child theme archive (zip) on your computer and click "Install Now".
7. On the following page, click "Activate".

### Using FTP

1. Download the [Clean Child Theme Kit](https://github.com/jbrad/clean-child-theme-kit/zipball/master).
2. Unzip the ```clean-child-theme-kit.zip``` archive on your computer.
3. Connect to your server via FTP.
4. Upload the extracted ```clean-child-theme-kit``` directory to the ```/wp-content/themes/``` directory on your server.
6. In the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to the "Themes" page under the "Appearance" menu.
7. Locate "Clean Child Theme Kit" and click "Activate".

## Usage

Find the ```style.css``` file for the Clean Child Theme Kit and locate the "Customizations" section. You can add your own styles under this section to override the styles that come with Clean.

If you happened to name Clean theme directory anything else besides "clean" when you installed the theme, you will need to update the "Template" name and the ```@import``` path in the Clean Child Theme Kit's ```style.css``` in order for it to work correctly.
